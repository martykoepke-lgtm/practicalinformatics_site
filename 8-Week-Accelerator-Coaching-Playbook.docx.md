# **8-Week App Accelerator**

Complete Coaching Playbook & Session Scripts

*From Idea to Shipped Product*

Built on ICF Core Competencies, GROW Model & Co-Active Coaching

# **Coaching Philosophy & Framework**

## **Core Principles**

This accelerator blends technical mentorship with transformational coaching. You're not just teaching someone to code—you're helping them become someone who ships. Every session balances:

* **Technical Transfer:** Skills, tools, and knowledge they need  
* **Coaching Presence:** Creating space for discovery and ownership  
* **Accountability:** Clear commitments with compassionate follow-through  
* **Co-Active Partnership:** They're naturally creative, resourceful, and whole

## **Session Structure (GROW \+ Technical)**

Each 60-minute session follows this flow:

| Time | Element |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0-5 min | **Opening & Check-in** — Arrive, ground, review commitments |
| 5-10 min | **Goal Setting** — What must this session accomplish? |
| 10-20 min | **Reality Check** — Where are you now? What's working/not? |
| 20-45 min | **Options & Build** — Technical work, problem-solving, hands-on |
| 45-55 min | **Way Forward** — Commitments, action steps, support needs |
| 55-60 min | **Close** — Acknowledge progress, schedule next session |

# **Pre-Program: Discovery & Intake**

**Timing:** Before Week 1 begins (30-45 minute discovery call \+ intake form)

## **Purpose**

Establish fit, surface the real motivation, and set clear expectations. This isn't just qualification—it's the beginning of the coaching relationship.

## **Discovery Call Script**

### **Opening (5 min)**

*"Thanks for taking the time to connect. Before we dive into the program details, I'd love to learn about you and what brought you here. What's the story behind wanting to build this app?"*

### **Core Discovery Questions**

1. *"What would it mean for you to actually ship this thing?"*  
2. *"What have you already tried? What happened?"*  
3. *"When you imagine yourself 8 weeks from now with a working app, what does that look like?"*  
4. *"What's your biggest fear about this process?"*  
5. *"What would make this investment worth it for you?"*  
6. *"How do you learn best? What does good support look like for you?"*  
7. *"What 3-5 hours per week look like in your schedule? When would you do the build work?"*

### **Technical Assessment Questions**

1. *"Have you ever written any code before? Even HTML, a WordPress site, spreadsheet formulas?"*  
2. *"How comfortable are you reading documentation when you're stuck?"*  
3. *"Tell me about the app you want to build. Who would use it? What problem does it solve?"*

### **Setting Expectations**

*"Here's what I want you to know: I don't teach you to 'vibe code.' I teach you to ship. That means understanding what the AI is doing, not just copying and pasting. You'll hit walls. You'll get frustrated. And you'll come out the other side with something real. Sound like what you're looking for?"*

## **Intake Form (Send After Discovery)**

Include these sections in your intake form:

* Contact information and preferred communication method  
* App concept description (2-3 paragraphs)  
* Primary target user  
* Technical background self-assessment (1-5 scale)  
* Weekly availability (specific time blocks)  
* Coaching agreement acknowledgment  
* Emergency contact (optional)

# **Phase 1: Clarity (Weeks 1-2)**

*Define the problem worth solving. Scope the MVP. Create a wireframe you can actually build.*

## **Week 1: Problem & User Discovery**

### **Session Objectives**

* Establish the coaching relationship and working rhythm  
* Surface the real problem (not just the symptom)  
* Define the primary user persona  
* Introduce the PRD template

### **Opening Ritual (5 min)**

*"Welcome to Week 1\. Before we start building, I want to check in with you as a person. How are you showing up today? What's on your mind?"*

**Coach Note:** Use Level 2 listening (focused listening). Don't just hear words—notice energy, hesitation, excitement. This is data.

### **Goal Setting (5 min)**

*"When you leave this session today, what would make it a success? What do you need to walk away with?"*  
Prompt them to articulate a specific outcome. If vague, ask: *"What would that look like specifically?"*

### **Reality & Exploration (15 min)**

**Problem Discovery Questions:**

1. *"Tell me about the problem you want to solve. What's frustrating about the current situation?"*  
2. *"Who experiences this problem most acutely?"*  
3. *"What are people doing right now to solve this? What's not working about those solutions?"*  
4. *"If your app existed today and worked perfectly, what would be different in their lives?"*  
5. *"What happens if this problem never gets solved?"*

**Go deeper:** *"What else? What more do you think, feel, or want to say about this?"*

**User Persona Questions:**

1. *"Describe your ideal user. Give them a name. What's their day like?"*  
2. *"What would make them try your app? What would make them come back?"*  
3. *"What technology do they already use comfortably?"*

### **Technical Transfer (25 min)**

**Introduce PRD Template:**

* Walk through each section of your PRD template  
* Demonstrate how to articulate user stories: "As a \[user\], I want to \[action\] so that \[benefit\]"  
* Show examples from your own projects (GovernIQ, Activiteez)

**Coaching Through Technical Work:**  
*"What part of this feels clear? What part feels fuzzy?"*  
*"Where do you think you'll get stuck when you work on this alone?"*

### **Way Forward (10 min)**

**Accountability Questions:**

1. *"What specific action will you take before our next session?"*  
2. *"When exactly will you do this? Put it in your calendar now."*  
3. *"On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to completing this? What would make it a 10?"*  
4. *"What support do you need from me between now and next week?"*

**Week 1 Deliverable:**

* Draft PRD with: Problem statement, target user persona, 3-5 user stories

### **Closing (5 min)**

*"What are you taking away from today's session?"*  
*"What did you notice about yourself during our conversation?"*  
*"Is there anything you want to acknowledge yourself for before we close?"*

## **Week 2: MVP Scoping & Wireframing**

### **Session Objectives**

* Review and refine PRD from Week 1  
* Ruthlessly cut scope to true MVP  
* Create low-fidelity wireframe

### **Opening & Accountability Check (10 min)**

*"How did your week go? Tell me about working on the PRD."*  
*"What came easily? What was harder than expected?"*  
*"What did you learn about yourself and your idea this week?"*

**If they didn't complete the work:** *"Help me understand what got in the way. What's underneath that?"*  
**Coach Note:** Don't shame. Get curious. Patterns here predict future patterns.

### **PRD Review (15 min)**

Review their PRD together. Ask:

1. *"Walk me through this. What's the core value proposition in one sentence?"*  
2. *"If you could only ship ONE feature, which one? Why that one?"*  
3. *"What on this list is 'nice to have' vs 'must have for launch'?"*  
4. *"What are you secretly hoping to include that isn't on this list?"* (surfaces scope creep)

### **The Cutting Exercise**

*"I'm going to push you here. We need to cut this list in half. What can you live without for V1?"*  
*"What would your user say is absolutely essential?"*  
*"What's the smallest thing you could ship that would still solve the core problem?"*

### **Technical Transfer: Wireframing (20 min)**

* Introduce Excalidraw, Figma, or paper sketching  
* Walk through user flow: Entry → Core Action → Exit  
* Demonstrate rough sketching (ugly is fine)  
* Discuss screen-by-screen: What does the user see? What do they do?

**Technical Feasibility Check:**  
*"Looking at this wireframe, what parts do you think will be hardest to build?"*  
Flag anything that might require external APIs, complex auth, or custom backends—discuss whether it's MVP-essential.

### **Way Forward (10 min)**

**Week 2 Deliverables:**

* Finalized PRD with MVP scope clearly marked  
* Complete wireframe for all MVP screens  
* User flow documented

**Confidence Check:** *"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you know what you're building? What would raise that number?"*

*"What excites you about starting to set up real tools?"*  
*"What feels uncertain or intimidating?"*

### **Tech Stack Decision (15 min)**

**Walk through the decision framework:**

* **Frontend:** React (via Next.js or Vite) — explain why  
* **Backend/Database:** Supabase — auth, database, storage in one

* **AI Coding:** Cursor \+ Claude/ChatGPT

*"What questions do you have about any of these choices?"*  
*"Is there anything about your app that might need something different?"*

### **Database Schema Design (20 min)**

**Coaching Through Technical Complexity:**  
*"Looking at your wireframe, what data does your app need to store?"*  
*"Walk me through a user flow. What data gets created, read, updated, deleted?"*  
*"What relationships exist between these things? A user has many \_\_\_\_\_?"*

**Whiteboard together:**

* Draw tables, columns, and relationships  
* Discuss primary keys, foreign keys  
* Talk through Row Level Security basics

### **Prompting Skills Introduction**

*"The quality of what AI builds depends on the quality of what you ask for. Let me show you what I mean."*

*"What did you try before asking for help?"* (Builds problem-solving muscle)

### **Debugging Together (20 min)**

This is likely where issues will surface. Use a coaching approach to debugging:

1. *"What did you expect to happen? What actually happened?"*  
2. *"What does the error message say? Let's read it together."*  
3. *"What have you already tried? What happened when you tried that?"*  
4. *"Where in your code do you think the problem might be? How would you test that hypothesis?"*

**Coach Note:** Resist the urge to just fix it for them. Guide them to the solution so they learn the pattern.
