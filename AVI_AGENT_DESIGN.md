# AI Visibility Index (AVI) — Agent System Design

**Document owner:** Marty Koepke, Practical Informatics LLC
**Status:** v1.0 — ready for Claude Code implementation
**Reference output:** `avi-report-practical-informatics.pdf` (the prototype report, hand-built in chat for Practical Informatics LLC — serves as the example deliverable the system must produce)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The AI Visibility Index (AVI) is a productized service that audits a business's visibility to AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini). It scores the business across six dimensions, runs live queries against real AI systems, compares them to competitors, and produces an actionable report.

The product has three stacked offerings:

- **Free AI Visibility Scan** — a 30-second lead-magnet teaser that returns an immediate preliminary score and gates an email-delivered full report behind a $497 unlock.
- **AI Visibility Report ($497)** — the full ~12-page audit + a 30-minute walk-through call.
- **Agentic Readiness Sprint ($2,997)** — two-week done-for-you implementation of the report's recommendations, plus a 60-day re-scan.
- **AI Visibility Monitoring ($397/mo)** — ongoing monthly re-scans, AI-mention tracking, schema maintenance.

The lead magnet runs on a Wizard-of-Oz architecture in the MVP: the user-facing experience is interactive (URL → instant preliminary score → "full report in 24 hours"), but the deep audit is delivered manually by Marty in the first 20–30 audits. Once the methodology is validated, the audit engine is automated.

---

## 2. The Product

### 2.1 What it is

A web application at `practicalinformatics.com/ai-visibility` that:

1. Captures a visitor's company URL and basic context (industry, competitors, location).
2. Runs a fast preliminary scan of their site (schema, llms.txt, robots.txt, basic content) and computes a teaser score in real time.
3. Captures the visitor's email and shows them the teaser score with 2–3 surface findings.
4. Emails them within 24 hours with a "full audit unlock" CTA at $497.
5. After payment, generates and delivers the full audit report — including live LLM queries, competitor comparison, prioritized fixes, projected post-fix score.
6. Schedules a 30-min walk-through call with the customer.
7. Offers the $2,997 Sprint as the upsell on the call.

### 2.2 The wedge

Most "AEO" / "AI SEO" tools either (a) score on surface-level structured data only, or (b) target enterprise. The AVI's differentiator is **the live AI test** — real, captured outputs from ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity/Gemini queried about the business and its competitors. That's the visceral moment that closes customers.

## 5. The Agent System (4 Agents + 1 Orchestrator)

The audit pipeline is decomposed into four specialist agents plus a coordinator. Each agent has clear inputs, outputs, and tool access. The orchestrator sequences them.

### 5.1 Crawler Agent

**Job:** Fetch and parse the target business's web presence.

**Inputs:**
- Target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
- Optional competitor URLs

**Tools:**
- Playwright (headless browser, JS-rendered content)
- `fetch` for robots.txt, llms.txt, sitemap.xml
- Schema.org JSON-LD parser
- HTML/OpenGraph meta extractor

**Outputs (JSON):**
```typescript
{
  url: string,
  fetchedAt: ISO8601,
  status: number,
  title: string,
  metaDescription: string,
  ogTags: Record<string, string>,
  schemaBlocks: JsonLd[],
  llmsTxt: string | null,
  robotsTxt: string,
  agentBotsAllowed: { gptbot: bool, claudebot: bool, perplexitybot: bool, googleExtended: bool, ccbot: bool },
  faqSchemaPresent: bool,
  personSchemaPresent: bool,
  serviceSchemaPresent: bool,
  organizationSchemaPresent: bool,
  sameAsLinks: string[],
  hasGoogleBusinessProfile: bool | "unknown",
  internalLinks: string[],
  outboundLinks: string[],
}
```

### 5.2 Query Agent

**Job:** Run live queries against AI systems and capture their responses about the business.

**Inputs:**
- Business name
- Industry
- Location
- Competitor names (optional)
- Custom queries

**Tools:**
- OpenAI API (gpt-4o or current model)
- Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4 or current)
- Perplexity API
- Google Gemini API
- (Optional) Brave Search API for cross-reference

**Default query set** (executed for every audit):
1. "Tell me about [Business Name]."
2. "Who is [Founder Name] of [Business Name]?"
3. "Best [industry] in [location]. Who should I call?"
4. "I need help with [problem]. Who do you recommend?"
5. "Compare [Business Name] and [Competitor 1]."
6. "Is [Business Name] reputable?"
7. "What is [signature methodology, e.g., 'the Time Back Assessment']?"

**Outputs (JSON):**
```typescript
{
  queries: Array<{
    query: string,
    model: "gpt-4o" | "claude-sonnet-4" | "perplexity" | "gemini",
    response: string,
    capturedAt: ISO8601,
    businessMentioned: bool,
    competitorMentioned: { name: string, mentioned: bool }[],
    accuracy: "accurate" | "partial" | "outdated" | "missing",
    sentiment: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative" | "missing",
    rawTokenCount: number,
  }>
}
```

### 5.3 Scoring Agent

**Job:** Take the Crawler + Query outputs and compute the AVI score across the six dimensions.

**Inputs:** Outputs of Crawler Agent and Query Agent. Plus business archetype (Solo Expert / Young Practice / Established / Mature).

**Tools:** Pure computation (no external calls).

**Outputs (JSON):**
```typescript
{
  archetype: "solo-expert" | "young-practice" | "established" | "mature",
  dimensions: {
    founderCredibility: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
    liveAITest: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
    entityClarity: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
    methodologyDepth: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
    structuredData: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
    agentCitationGraph: { score: number, max: number, findings: string[] },
  },
  totalScore: number,        // 0-100
  tier: "Agent-Ready" | "Discoverable" | "Faintly Visible" | "Hidden" | "Invisible",
  projectedScoreAfterFixes: number,
  topFixes: Array<{
    title: string,
    priority: "high" | "med" | "low",
    effortHours: number,
    impactPoints: number,
    description: string,
    whyItMatters: string,
  }>,
}
```

See **Section 8 — AVI Scoring Methodology** for the per-archetype weights and per-dimension rules.

### 5.4 Report Agent

**Job:** Generate the polished, branded report deliverable.

**Inputs:** Outputs of all three prior agents.

**Tools:**
- HTML template renderer (React Server Components or a templating engine)
- WeasyPrint or Puppeteer (HTML → PDF)
- Storage (Supabase Storage or S3-compatible) for the PDF

**Outputs:**
- HTML report at `/reports/[id]` (public hosted URL, signed access token)
- PDF mirror at `/reports/[id]/pdf` (downloadable)
- Email-ready summary HTML

**Report structure** (must match the reference PDF `avi-report-practical-informatics.pdf`):
1. Cover — AVI Score (big number) + tier
2. Executive Summary (1 page)
3. Live AI Test — 4–6 query result boxes with screenshots/text + analysis
4. Six Dimensions Scorecard — radar chart + 6 dimension cards
5. Competitor Comparison — table comparing target vs. 2 competitors
6. Prioritized Fix List — top 10 with effort/impact/priority pills
7. Projected Score (with visual "now → 60 days" element)
8. The Sprint upsell ($2,997) — CTA block
9. Methodology appendix

### 5.5 Orchestrator

**Job:** Sequence the agents and persist outputs.

**Sequence:**
```
[trigger: paid submission]
  → Crawler Agent (target URL, competitor URLs)  [parallel possible]
  → Query Agent (business name, industry, etc.)  [parallel with Crawler]
  → Scoring Agent (combines outputs)
  → Report Agent (renders HTML + PDF)
  → Email Service (delivers report)
  → Database write (audit complete)
```

For the **MVP**, the Orchestrator is essentially Marty. She reviews the submission, manually runs the audit, and uses the system to generate the report. For **V2**, the Orchestrator is an automated pipeline triggered by Stripe webhook.

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=                          # server-side only
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=         # browser-safe
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=                      # V2

# Data store
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHEET_ENDPOINT=                 # MVP — Apps Script webhook URL

## 15. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Landing + Form (week 1)
1. Build `/ai-visibility` landing page (copy, pricing, design)
2. Build `/ai-visibility/scan` form
3. Wire form submission to Google Sheet via Apps Script
4. Build the scanning animation
5. Build `/ai-visibility/results/[id]` teaser page (with a dumb static score for testing)
6. Build the Crawler Agent (lightweight version that runs in 10s)
7. Connect: form submit → real Crawler run → real teaser score
8. Email notification to Marty when new submission arrives
9. Confirmation email to visitor

### Phase 2 — Payment + Hosted Report (week 2)
10. Create Stripe Payment Link for the $497 Report
11. Build `/ai-visibility/scheduled` confirmation page with calendar embed
12. Build `/reports/[id]` hosted report page (template; fillable from data file)
13. Build PDF export route
14. Email templates (teaser delivery, full report delivery, call reminder, post-call follow-up)
15. Manual orchestration runbook for Marty (the audit checklist for each customer)

### Phase 3 — Automation (after 20 audits validated)
16. Migrate to Supabase
17. Build Query Agent (real LLM API calls)
18. Build Scoring Agent (automated)
19. Build Report Agent (automated rendering)
20. Stripe webhook → automated pipeline trigger
21. Resend integration
22. Internal admin dashboard for monitoring

---

## 16. Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is considered shippable when:

- [ ] A visitor can fill the form on `/ai-visibility/scan` and submit successfully
- [ ] The submission writes to the Google Sheet
- [ ] Marty receives an email notification of each new submission
- [ ] The visitor sees a real preliminary score on `/ai-visibility/results/[id]` (not a fake one)
- [ ] The preliminary score is derived from a real Crawler Agent run against their URL
- [ ] The visitor receives an automated confirmation email
- [ ] The Stripe Payment Link is accessible from the teaser page
- [ ] After payment, the visitor lands on `/ai-visibility/scheduled` and can book a call
- [ ] Marty can hand-fill the report template and generate a polished PDF + hosted URL
- [ ] The PDF/HTML matches the visual fidelity of `avi-report-practical-informatics.pdf`
- [ ] All API keys are correctly placed (none behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_` that shouldn't be)
- [ ] The Vercel deploy succeeds and the live site runs the full flow end-to-end

## 17. Open Decisions

Items still requiring a decision before V2:

1. **Email provider for V2** — Resend vs. Postmark vs. SendGrid. Default to Resend (best DX, modern).
2. **Background worker** — Vercel Edge Functions vs. Inngest vs. Trigger.dev for the orchestrator. Default to Inngest for the V2 (built for this pattern).
3. **Hosted report access model** — Signed token in URL vs. magic link via email vs. customer login. Default to signed token (simplest; 6-month expiry).
4. **Should the teaser-results page show a "Marty's note" video** — recorded once, re-rendered per customer with their name overlaid? Could be powerful but adds complexity. Decide after MVP.
5. **Custom-domain reports** — Should `reports.practicalinformatics.com` be a separate subdomain? Default to keeping reports at the main domain under `/reports/[id]` for simplicity.
6. **Pricing inflation** — Should the $497 price be tested against $297 and $797 on different cohorts? Defer until 30+ paid customers.

## 18. Notes for Claude Code

When implementing this:

- **Read CLAUDE.md first** — it has the project context, design system, and tech-stack conventions.
- **Match the existing design system** — colors, fonts, motion, section tones. The new pages should feel of-a-piece with the rest of the site.
- **Don't over-engineer the MVP** — Wizard-of-Oz is the right pattern. The first 20 audits will be hand-done. Build the surfaces, defer the automation.
- **All AI API keys are server-side only.** No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix on `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`. Ever.
- **Validate the form** — URL must be a valid URL; email must be valid; industry required. Show inline errors.
- **Rate-limit submissions** — one free scan per email address per 24 hours (prevent abuse).
- **Honest preliminary score** — the teaser should not lie. If we can only detect 3 issues from the lightweight crawl, show 3. Don't fabricate findings.
- **Privacy** — submissions store email + URL. Don't store anything not necessary. Don't sell. Disclose in /privacy.
- **Accessibility** — match the existing site's accessibility posture (keyboard nav, ARIA, reduced motion). The scanning animation must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Reference output** — `avi-report-practical-informatics.pdf` shows exactly what the report should look like. Match its structure, sections, and visual treatment.

**End of document.**

When Claude Code receives this, the first step is: read this entire document, read `CLAUDE.md`, then read the existing `lib/content.ts` and `app/page.tsx` to understand the established conventions before writing any new code.
