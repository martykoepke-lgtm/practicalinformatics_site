      q: "How long does the whole thing take from start to finish?",
      a: "About four weeks. One week to schedule the visit, seven business days for me to deliver the report, then a 30-minute follow-up call and the quick win implementation within two weeks after that.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is this on-site or remote?",
      a: "On-site is the original format and works best. I take on a limited number of remote and hybrid versions when the work fits the format. Reach out and we'll figure out together what shape this takes for your business.",

      q: "What if I don't see a quick win I want to implement?",
      a: "That happens rarely, but it happens. If the best opportunities are all bigger than a 3-hour fix, I'll credit that time toward a larger engagement if you move forward, or you can use it as an extended advisory call to map out the implementation plan together.",

      a: "The AVI is the productized, focused product — outward-facing, $697, five business days. The Time Back Assessment is the deeper, custom engagement — inward-facing, $1,500, four-week timeline. Many clients start with the AVI and add the Time Back when they want the full operational picture.",
