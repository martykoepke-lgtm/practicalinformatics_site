Then we fix it. Sometimes the answer is AI. Often it\'s smarter process, a better tool, or maybe something custom that is made just for you. I\'ll tell you plainly which is which.',

The tools vary — electronic health records, clinical workflows, regulatory systems — but the diagnosis is always the same.",
    "What I learned, over those fifteen years, is that almost no organization has actually mapped where its own time goes. We feel like we're drowning, blame ourselves, work longer hours, and don't step back to ask if the work is organized right in the first place. That's true in a health system. It's true in a winery, a contractor's shop, an accounting practice, a small law firm.",
    "What's changed in the last couple of years is what's possible to do about it. AI didn't make the pattern — the pattern's been there forever. But AI made a lot of the fixes much easier, if you know what to fix in the first place. Most of the “AI for small business” content out there skips that question. I don't.",
